  <div id="description" class="item"><center><h3>Description</h3><br><p> During the summer, I began biking almost everyday. I made it a goal of mine to bike at least 10 miles each session. I was able to build a routine and lost 30lbs because of this. I used an app called "Strava" to track every biking session. This app allowed me to view the statistics for every session I log. The longest distance I traveled was 22.51 miles in the span of 1 hour and 47 minutes. The bike that I used was a fixed gear and is pretty cheap compared to most cyclists. I mainly biked in a velodrome next to me. This allowed me to focus on endurance and speed when biking. From this experience, I learned the power of habit.</p></div>
